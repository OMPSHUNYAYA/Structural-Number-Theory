# ⭐ Shunyaya Structural Number Theory (SSNT)

## Quickstart

**Deterministic • Integer Behavior • Structural Time • Fractures • Belts • Finite Alphabet**

---

## WHAT YOU NEED

Shunyaya Structural Number Theory (SSNT) is intentionally **minimal**, **deterministic**, and **implementation-neutral**.

### Requirements

- **Python 3.9+**
- **Standard library only** (no external dependencies)

Everything is:

- deterministic  
- offline  
- reproducible  
- identical across machines  

No randomness.  
No training.  
No probabilistic heuristics.  
No adaptive tuning.

---

## MINIMAL PROJECT LAYOUT (PUBLIC RELEASE)

A minimal, review-grade SSNT release contains only two front-door artifacts:

```

/SSNT
  ssnt_run_all.py
  SSNT_ALL_RUN_0001/

```

### Entry point

- **ssnt_run_all.py**  
  Single deterministic runner that reproduces the entire SSNT pipeline.

### Canonical reference run

- **SSNT_ALL_RUN_0001/**  
  Frozen, hash-verified empirical record generated by the master runner.

Inside the reference run:

- structural time outputs (rows, transitions, fractures)
- corridor epochs
- fracture cluster epochs
- structural belts
- SSNT signatures
- alphabet evolution
- master manifest with SHA-256 hashes

This folder is the **empirical ground truth** cited throughout the SSNT documentation.

---

## ARCHIVE POLICY

Earlier scripts, intermediate runs, and exploratory outputs are intentionally excluded from the public Quickstart.

They are:

- reproducible via `ssnt_run_all.py`
- preserved internally
- not required for review, validation, or replication

This ensures:

- clarity for reviewers
- zero ambiguity on what to run
- a clean, infrastructure-grade release surface

---

## HOW TO RUN (ONE COMMAND)

From the project root:

`python ssnt_run_all.py --run-id RUN_0001 --n-max 20000`

This command deterministically executes:

- SSNT structural time scan
- transition computation
- fracture detection
- corridor epoch construction
- belt construction
- signature encoding
- alphabet evolution

The outputs will match **exactly** the contents of `SSNT_ALL_RUN_0001`.

---

## ONE-MINUTE MENTAL MODEL

Classical number theory asks:

**“What properties does this number have?”**

SSNT asks:

**“How does this number behave under deterministic structural pressure?”**

SSNT does not replace primes, factors, or divisibility.  
It observes how integers **yield**, **resist**, **fracture**, and **transition** when exposed to factor pressure.

Integers are treated as **processes**, not static symbols.

---

## CORE STRUCTURAL IDEA (ONE LINE)

Integers accumulate structural strain under factor pressure and yield at different depths — revealing behavior, not just order.

---

## WHAT SSNT TRACKS

SSNT operates on deterministic structural observables:

- `d_min(n)` — smallest divisor ≥ 2  
- `L(n) = floor(sqrt(n))`  
- `t_hat(n)` — normalized closure depth  
- `t_hat_1e6(n)` — integer-scaled closure depth  

From transitions `n → n+1`, SSNT derives:

- `Delta_t_hat_1e6(n)` — structural time jump  
- corridor regimes: **CALM / NORMAL / SHOCK**  
- fracture classes (**MODERATE / STRONG / EXTREME**)  
- oscillatory fracture pairs  
- regional belts  
- shock-free and fracture-cluster epochs  

No probabilities.  
No smoothing.  
No approximations.

---

## STRUCTURAL TIME (KEY EXTENSION)

SSNT does not assume time.

It **reconstructs time from structure**.

Structural time is inferred from:

- closure depth differences
- transition strain
- silence vs jump behavior

This reveals:

- when integers yield
- how violently they transition
- where silence precedes collapse

Integer behavior is **timed**, not instantaneous.

---

## STRUCTURAL FRACTURES

A fracture occurs when:

`abs(Delta_t_hat_1e6(n)) >= F_hat`

Thresholds are explicit and deterministic:

- `F_hat` — fracture onset  
- `F_strong` — strong fracture  
- `F_extreme` — extreme fracture  

Observed properties:

- fractures are sparse
- fractures occur as paired oscillations
- symmetry persists across modular slicing
- fracture counts align exactly with SHOCK corridors

Fractures are **events**, not noise.

---

## BELTS AND EPOCHS (STRUCTURAL GEOGRAPHY)

SSNT reveals that the integer line is **not homogeneous**.

It contains:

- fracture belts (persistent high-strain regions)
- calm corridors
- shock-free epochs
- clustered fracture epochs

Belts and epochs are:

- deterministic
- regional
- lens-robust
- reproducible across runs

This introduces **structural geography** into number theory.

---

## THE SSNT SIGNATURE (FINITE STRUCTURAL ALPHABET)

Each transition `n → n+1` is encoded as:

`SSNT_SIG(n) = <U, C, F, O, B>`

Where:

- `U` — undefined (prime-involved) indicator  
- `C` — corridor regime  
- `F` — fracture class  
- `O` — oscillatory pair flag  
- `B` — belt membership bitmask  

This yields:

- a finite alphabet of structural behavior
- convergence with increasing `n`
- a compact, lossless representation of SSNT behavior

SSNT discovers a **finite language of integer behavior**, not a single governing formula.

---

## ALPHABET CONVERGENCE

As `n_max` increases:

- new signatures appear rapidly at small `n`
- appearance rate slows dramatically
- the alphabet converges to a finite set

This confirms:

- SSNT behavior is not unbounded
- integer behavior is structurally compressible
- SSNT defines a stable behavioral language

---

## DETERMINISM GUARANTEE

Given identical inputs:

- same rows
- same transitions
- same fractures
- same belts
- same signatures
- same alphabet counts

SSNT guarantees:

- no randomness
- no machine dependence
- no hidden state

Results are fully reproducible and hash-verifiable.

---

## WHAT SSNT IS — AND IS NOT

### SSNT is:

- a behavioral theory of integers
- a structural extension of number theory
- a deterministic observational framework
- compatible with classical mathematics

### SSNT is not:

- a prime test
- a conjecture engine
- a probabilistic model
- a replacement for number theory

It does not change mathematics.  
It reveals how mathematics behaves.

---

## ONE-LINE SUMMARY

**Shunyaya Structural Number Theory deterministically reveals integers as behavioral structures — exhibiting strain, fracture, silence, and regional order — forming a finite, convergent language of integer transitions beyond classical divisibility.**
