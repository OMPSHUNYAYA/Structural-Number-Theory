Research and Usage Notice

Shunyaya Structural Number Theory (SSNT) is a deterministic, observational framework for analyzing integer behavior under structural transition, including:

structural time on integers

transition corridors (CALM / NORMAL / SHOCK / UNDEFINED)

fracture events and fracture clustering

belts and regional structural geography

finite behavioral signatures and alphabet evolution

SSNT is provided for:

mathematical research

structural analysis of integers

behavioral pattern inspection

cross-validation and reproducibility studies

educational and exploratory use

SSNT is NOT:

a replacement for classical number theory

a probabilistic or statistical model

a prime prediction system

a conjecture-generating oracle

a cryptographic guarantee

a numerology or pattern-mining heuristic

SSNT does not modify arithmetic, divisibility rules, or number-theoretic definitions.
It introduces structural observables to study transition behavior, not to assert new axioms.

Any interpretation beyond mathematics must be done explicitly and independently by the user.

Responsibility and Scope

Any use of SSNT for:

cryptography

security claims

predictive systems

decision-making

safety-critical or regulatory contexts

is undertaken entirely at the user’s own responsibility.

SSNT provides observational structure, not guarantees, control, or authority.
